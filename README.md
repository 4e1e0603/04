__Programming in Python from zero to hero.__

The introductory course, examples, and exercises in Python programming language. Originally written for personal needs  but may be useful for other people.

## Overview

### Stage 1

In the *Stage 1* you will not only learn the basics of Python programming language, but also how to setup your development environment, how to use the command line interface and how to use another services as `GitHub` together with *Git* tool. Your knowledge after this stage will be shallow but you will be able to solve some basic and practical problems.

### Stage 2

In the *Stage 2* you will learn how to solve general and practical problems with Python.

### Stage 3

Choode your path:

1. Python for data analysis.
2. Python for automated testing.
3. Python for scientific programming.

## Setup

- Installation and usage of command line interface.
- Installation of Python (v3) interpeter.
- Overview of GitHub service and creation of an account (GitHub Web and CLI).
- Installation of Git and basic commands.
- Your first Python program ("hello world").

## Data types and data structures

- Number (int, float, decimal, fraction)
- String

### Containters

- Sequence: List, Tuple, Set
- Mapping: Dictionary
- Array, Matrix
- Comprehension (list, dict) and slicing
- sorting: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html

## Type annotations

- Dynamic vs static typing
- Type hints and static analysis
- MyPy and Pylance and 

## Code formatting

- Indentation
- Using `black`!

## Functions

- What is a function (builtin vs custom).
- What if function doesn't return value?
- Funtion without arguments
- Function with one argument
- Function with one argument and default value
- Funtionn with multiple arguments
- Using named and default arguments (How to define default empty list!)
- Using `*args`and `*kwargs*`
- How to write proper function comment.
- closure, variable scope
- higher order functions and functional programming

## Modules & Packages

- module definition
- module import and export
- package definition

## Decorators

## Classes & Methods

- abstract classes & inheritance
- single vs multiple inheritance
- special (magic) methods and operators 
  - `__init__`, `__new__`, `__dict__`
  - `[]`, ``
- properties, abstract, static and class methods
- dataclasses https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html; https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/
- `__slots__`
- protocols, nominal vs structurel subtyping

### Methods

### Properties

## File IO

- How to read and write to/from file, synchronous (blocking) API.
- Using `pathlib`
-  `with` statement and cotext manager (`with open(...) as _`)

## Calendar, Date and Time

How to work with date and time.

- `date` module
- `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `timedelta` classes
- `time.min`, `time.max` properties
- `datetime.combine(datetime.now(), time.min)`

## Pattern Matching 

- https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/

## Iterators and Generators

- `__iter__`, `__next__`, `yield`, `yield from`

## Jupyter and Notebooks

How to work with interactive notebooks.
- Using Jupyter and JupyterLab web interface.
- Using Visual Studio Code Editor interface.
- Convert script to netobook and vice versa.
- Manage code and notes in notebook and best practices. 

## Async/Await

Asynchronous (non-blocking) programming.

## Metaprogramming

- Reflection

## Testing

- Unit tests with `pytest`
- `assert`, `fixture`, `test-case`
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html
- `pytest.mark`
- `pytest.parametrize`

## Style guide

prefer 

    week_start: date

over 

    start_of_week: date
